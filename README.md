## Abstract

The "Bank Network System" is a simulated infrastructure created using Packet Tracer, designed to emulate a multi-branch banking network integrated with a centralized server and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This system aims to provide secure and efficient communication between various bank branches, ensuring seamless data exchange and reliable connectivity. Each branch operates as a node within the network, connecting to a central server for data management, transaction processing, and centralized control. The integration of IoT devices enables real-time monitoring and management of various operational aspects, enhancing the system's functionality and security.

The simulation showcases the complexities of managing a distributed banking network, with a focus on secure communication, robust connectivity, and optimal resource utilization. It emphasizes the importance of secure communication networks and innovative technologies like IoT devices in modern banking systems.
